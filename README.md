# Spam Destroyer WordPress Plugin

## Description

Spam Destroyer is a WordPress plugin designed to annihilate comment spam on your website. This plugin uses a combination of JavaScript and PHP to verify the authenticity of comments. 

## Features

- Cookie-based verification
- JavaScript key validation
- Easy to use, zero config

## Mode of Action

The plugin employs two methods for spam prevention: altering a hidden input field via JavaScript and setting a cookie. Both are verified on the backend; incorrect implementation leads to the form being marked as spam and rejected. Most spam bots don't execute JavaScript, making them easily detectable due to the absence of the input field and cookie.

## Akismet Comparison

In tests, Spam Destroyer proved 20x more effective than Akismet. While both can be used simultaneously, they employ different anti-spam strategies. For servers burdened by spam, is preferable to use Spam Destroyer as well as Aksimet, as it blocks spam before hitting your WordPress database, reducing Akismet's workload.

## Limitations of this Alpha version
Unlike the stable release, this version does not include a fall-back CAPTCHA for when a user may fail the CAPTCHA due to a browser or general site problem. It also doesn't include support for bbPress, WP multisite, BuddyPress, Jetpack contact forms etc.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin and extract it.
2. Upload the `spam-destroyer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Note: Once this becomes stable, it will also be available through both Composer and the official WordPress plugin repository.

## Usage

After activation, the plugin works automatically. No configuration needed.
